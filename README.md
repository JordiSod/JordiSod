### Hello friend! ðŸ‘‹

I just finished the fabulous **Data Science Bootcamp** at **Le Wagon Mexico** ðŸ¥³ and will be adding new features to my GitHub page. Watch this space!

My final project at the bootcamp was a wine recommendation app, [Bright Toast](https://jordisod-bright-toast-brightapp-llrlza.streamlit.app/). Give it a go.
